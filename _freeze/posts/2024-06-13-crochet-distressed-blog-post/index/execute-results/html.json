Although it might look intricate, this top only requires double crochets, and the distressed part is just a chain stretched out super long!\n\n# Materials\n\n5mm crochet hook (I used a slightly larger hook for looser stitches)\\\nDK yarn\\\nStitch markers (safety pins, paper clips, or bobby pins work great)\\\nDarning needle\\\nScissors\\\nMeasuring tape\\\n\n# Tutorial\n\nHere's the youtube tutorial I followed to make this top!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"vembedr\">\n<div>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCnk-3FM22Q\" width=\"533\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Tips\n\nTry to keep your tension looser than normal for a more distressed look, or try experimenting with different tensions and colors to add some interest! Also, you will get caught in things while wearing this top out but just embrace it (it also adds to the distressed look)\n",
