I ended up making my bag around 9x12 inches, which fits my iPad, 24oz water bottle, headphones, keys, wallet, phone, and more. I also sewed a felt star onto my bag, but feel free to add any design you'd like!\n\n# Materials\n\n5mm crochet hook\\\nDK or worsted yarn\\\nStitch markers (safety pins, paper clips, or bobby pins work great)\\\nDarning needle\\\nScissors\\\nMeasuring tape\\\n\n# Tutorial\n\nHere's the youtube tutorial that inspired this bag!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"vembedr\">\n<div>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBN1y6OOLM4\" width=\"533\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Tips\n\nThe above tutorial is for a smaller bag, but just add more chains and rows to increase the size. Lining the bag with sturdy fabric also prevents the bag from stretching! I also added a magnetic button for easy open/closure and an inside pocket for fast access to smaller items, along with a removable plastic bottom for extra support. If you decide to line your bag, I recommend using clear sewing thread so you don't see your stitches.\n",
