I like paring this top with jeans or underneath overalls! \n\n# Materials\n\n4.25mm crochet hook (I accidentally used a smaller hook)\\\nDK yarn\\\nStitch markers (safety pins, paper clips, or bobby pins work great)\\\nDarning needle\\\nScissors\\\nMeasuring tape\\\n\n# Tutorial\n\nHere's the youtube tutorial I followed to make this top!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"vembedr\">\n<div>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fjdqGCWym8\" width=\"533\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Tips\n\nIt took me a long time to get the hang of this pattern, so if you're having a hard time making this top too, don't feel discouraged! I also found it difficult to see which part of the pattern I was making while crocheting each row. So, I recommend making a practice swatch to help you get used to identifying which part of the flower you're crocheting.\n",
