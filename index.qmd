# About me
Hi! I’m Katelyn Vidal, and I’m a third-year Environmental Studies major with a strong passion for restoration. Some of my involvements at UCSB include being on the art committee for the Isla Vista Trading Post and volunteering with the Edible Campus Program. My hobbies include drawing, painting, gardening, crocheting, bird watching, and showing people pictures of my dogs.
