# Description

This top is great for beginners and builds up super quickly too, making this a great last-minute Halloween outfit!

# Materials

4.25mm crochet hook (I used a slightly larger hook for looser stitches)\
Superfine-fine yarn (any thin yarn works)\
Stitch markers (safety pins, paper clips, or bobby pins work great)\
Darning needle\
Scissors\
Measuring tape\
Patience

# Tutorial

Here's the youtube tutorial I followed to make this top!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(vembedr)
embed_url("https://youtu.be/VtQjWlf8NKA?si=PBttz-VHR5P1EyN6")
```

# Tips

I highly recommend using stitch markers to keep track of your rows because it can get a bit tricky as you go. Also, the video tutorial includes sleeves, but if you want to recreate the top like how I made it, just skip that part!
