# Description

This top is a perfect project if you're looking for something to make that will crochet the stress away. Although it might look intricate, this top only requires double crochets, and the distressed part is just a chain stretched out super long!

# Materials

5mm crochet hook (I used a slightly larger hook for looser stitches)\
DK yarn\
Stitch markers (safety pins, paper clips, or bobby pins work great)\
Darning needle\
Scissors\
Measuring tape\

# Tutorial

Here's the youtube tutorial I followed to make this top!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(vembedr)

```

# Tips

Try to keep your tension looser than normal for a more distressed look, or try experimenting with different tensions and colors to add some interest! Also, you will get caught in things while wearing this top out but just embrace it (it also adds to the distressed look)
