# Description

This lace top is more difficult compared to the other ones I've shown but once you get the hang of the pattern, it gets easier. I like paring this top with jeans or underneath overalls! 

# Materials

4.25mm crochet hook (I accidentally used a smaller hook)\
DK yarn\
Stitch markers (safety pins, paper clips, or bobby pins work great)\
Darning needle\
Scissors\
Measuring tape\

# Tutorial

Here's the youtube tutorial I followed to make this top!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(vembedr)

# Tips

It took me a long time to get the hang of this pattern, so if you're having a hard time making this top too, don't feel discouraged! I also found it difficult to see which part of the pattern I was making while crocheting each row. So, I recommend making a practice swatch to help you get used to identifying which part of the flower you're crocheting.
