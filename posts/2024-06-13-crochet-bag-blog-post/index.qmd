# Description

This bag is another great project for beginners because it's made using one stitch (double crochet). I ended up making my bag around 9x12 inches, which fits my iPad, 24oz water bottle, headphones, keys, wallet, phone, and more. I also sewed a felt star onto my bag, but feel free to add any design you'd like!

# Materials

5mm crochet hook\
DK or worsted yarn\
Stitch markers (safety pins work great)\
Darning needle\
Scissors\
Measuring tape\

# Tutorial

Here's the youtube tutorial I followed to make this top!

# Tips

The above tutorial is for a smaller bag, but just add more chains and rows to increase the size. Lining the bag with sturdy fabric also prevents the bag from stretching! I also added a magnetic button for easy open/closure and an inside pocket for fast access to smaller items, along with a removable plastic bottom for extra support. If you decide to line your bag, I recommend using clear sewing thread so you don't see your stitches.
